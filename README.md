# FoundryVTT dnd5e Jump Calculator
This is a simple module which integrates with the default 5e character sheet to add Jump Calculator buttons to the Details tab of the sheet. 

- First ensure that your character has a Strength score (on the Details tab of the character sheet)
- Enter a height value (on the Biography tab of the character sheet) in the format `6' 2"` - which represents `six feet twoo inches`. Please ensure that you enter the correct format: number followed by single quote followed by space, followed by number, followed by double quote. If you get that wrong the calculator won't work.
- Once the module is enabled you will an additional section on the Details tab, titled "Jump Calculator" which includes the buttons.
- Click one of the buttons to generate your jump info to the Chat bar.
- Only works with dnd5e system version 3+ and Foundry v11+
- Includes support for Active Effects. To use this, add an effect (either directly to an actor, or to an item like a spell), using an Attribute Key value of "dnd5e.foundryvtt-dnd5e-jump-calculator". (see Fig.1 and Fig.2)
