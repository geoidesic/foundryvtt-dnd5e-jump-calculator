# FoundryVTT dnd5e Jump Calculator
This is a simple module which integrates with the default 5e character sheet to add Jump Calculator buttons to the Details tab of the sheet. 

- First ensure that your character has a Strength score (on the Details tab of the character sheet)
- Enter a height value in the format `6' 2"` - which represents `six feet 2 inches`. Please ensure that you enter the correct format: number followed by single quote followed by space, followed by number, followed by double quote. If you get that wrong the calculator won't work.
- Once the module is enabled you will an additional section on the Details tab, titled "Jump Calculator" which includes the buttons.
- Click one of the buttons to generate your jump info to the Chat bar.
